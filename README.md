# ðŸ¤– Hello there.

You have reached my Neovim config. Here be dragons alright.

Todo:

- [ ] Snippets? Snippets!
- [ ] cmp/lsp should show icons for different kinds of suggestions (Snippet, Methods, Properties, etc)
- [ ] Show current file inside buffer
- [ ] CursorLine could be darker than background
- [ ] Current Line number should be colored
